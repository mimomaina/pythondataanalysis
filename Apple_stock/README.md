# Apple Stock Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a comprehensive time series analysis on Apple's stock price data from December 1980 to July 2014.

## Overview

The notebook, `Apple_stock.ipynb`, guides the user through a complete data analysis workflow, from data loading and cleaning to exploration and visualization. It serves as an excellent educational resource for learning data manipulation and analysis techniques using Python's pandas and matplotlib libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from a public GitHub repository:
- **Source**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises/master/09_Time_Series/Apple_Stock/appl_1980_2014.csv`
- **Time Period**: December 12, 1980 - July 8, 2014
- **Records**: 8,465 rows
- **Features**:
  - `Date`: The trading date.
  - `Open`: The opening price of the stock.
  - `High`: The highest price of the stock during the day.
  - `Low`: The lowest price of the stock during the day.
  - `Close`: The closing price of the stock.
  - `Volume`: The number of shares traded.
  - `Adj Close`: The adjusted closing price, which accounts for corporate actions like dividends and stock splits.

## Analysis Steps

The notebook follows a structured approach to analyze the data:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**: The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and its basic structure is examined.
2.  **Data Type Conversion**: The `Date` column is converted from a string to a `datetime` object for proper time series handling.
3.  **Indexing**: The `Date` column is set as the DataFrame's index to facilitate time-based operations.
4.  **Data Quality Check**: The analysis checks for duplicate dates, which could distort results. The dataset was found to have no duplicates.
5.  **Data Sorting**: The data is sorted chronologically so that the earliest date (1980-12-12) is the first entry and the most recent date (2014-07-08) is the last.
6.  **Time Series Resampling**: The notebook calculates the last business day of each month to create a monthly time series.
7.  **Temporal Analysis**: The total time span of the dataset is calculated, revealing a period of 12,261 days (approximately 33.6 years). It also counts the number of months covered, which is 404.
8.  **Data Visualization**: The `Adj Close` price is plotted over the entire time period to visualize the long-term trend.
9.  **Bonus Insight**: A bonus question is answered, identifying the highest closing price in the dataset as $702.10.

## Key Insights

*   **Long-Term Growth**: The visualization of the Adjusted Close price shows a remarkable long-term upward trend, reflecting Apple's growth from a technology startup to a global leader over the 33+ year period.
*   **Significant Milestone**: The highest closing price in the dataset is $702.10, highlighting the peak value of the stock during this historical period.
*   **Data Quality**: The dataset is well-structured with no duplicate dates, making it reliable for analysis.

## Recommendations

*   **Further Analysis**: This cleaned and structured dataset is an excellent foundation for more advanced analyses, such as calculating daily returns, identifying volatility patterns, or applying forecasting models.
*   **Update the Dataset**: For a more current analysis, consider sourcing more recent Apple stock data to extend the time series beyond 2014.
*   **Expand the Scope**: The analysis could be expanded by comparing Apple's performance to a market index (like the S&P 500) or to other technology companies.
